## Compilation

This website is built using several compilable languages:

- The HTML pages are built from **pug** template files.
- The CSS stylesheet is pre-compiled from **sass** files.
- The JS scripts are trans-compiled from **es6** (ES2015) files. 

To make any modifications re-compilation is necessary. You should install:

- **node** and **npm**
- **yarn**
- **gulp** (install globally)

Afterwards run the following in the command line:

```
cd src
yarn
```

After it runs succesfuly you can compile as needed:

- **sass (stylesheets)**
    ```
    gulp styles
    ```
  
- **scripts (ES6)**
    ```
    gulp scripts
    gulp dependencies
    ```

Either of these can be run separately.

- **pug (HTML pages)**
    ```
    gulp html
    ```

- **all**
    ```
    yarn run build
    ```

- **Watch and compile automatically on changes**
    ```
    gulp watch
    ```
